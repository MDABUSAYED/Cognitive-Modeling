Understanding human decision making when prompted with choices of various costs is essential in many areas such as in cyber security. 
In this paper we will use a deception game (DG) to examine different costs of probing on adversarial decisions. To achieve this we utilized
an IBLT model and a delayed feedback mechanism to mimic knowledge of human actions. Our results were taken from an even split of deception 
and no deception to compare each influence. It was concluded that probing was slightly taken less as the cost of probing increased. 
The proportion of attacks stayed relatively the same as the cost of probing increased. Although a constant cost led to a slight decrease
in attacks. Overall, our results concluded that the different  probing costs do not have impact on the proportion of attacks whereas it 
had a slight noticeable impact on the proportion of probing.
